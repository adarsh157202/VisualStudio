	<p>the strong element indicates that its content has strong importance . For example : <strong>Beware</strong> The
		dog bites</p>
	<p>The em tag indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. For example: <br />

	<p>there are two elements used for marking up quotations
		<ul>
			<li>blockquotes: it is used for longer quotes that take up entire paragraph. <br />For example:
				<blockquote>
					<p>Did you ever stop to think and forget to start again?</p>
				</blockquote>
			</li>
			<li>q: it is used to for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. <br />For example: <p>As A.A. Milne
					said, <q>Some people talk to animals . Not many listen though. That's the problem .</q></p>
