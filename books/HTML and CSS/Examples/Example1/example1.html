        The story in the Book
    </h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
        <em>Nature ,New Scientists,</em> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
        thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she
        spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that
        <q>WWork is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work
        unravelig the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid">DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding
        achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
